<h3>ComebackTwitterEmbed Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This bot can review the content of messages you send.  </p>
<p>This bot will only use the content of the message for processing and will not retrieve attachments or other files.  </p>
<p>The content of your message is only used to check if your message contains a tag that activates the automatic link embedding feature, and is not used for any other purpose.  </p>
<p>We also do not record the messages you send.  </p>
<p>You can always use the "/settings disable user" command to exclude yourself from message retrieval.  </p>
<p>If you are the server administrator, you can also use the "/settings disable channel" command to disable all messages in a particular channel.  </p>
<p>If (unfortunately) you don't trust us, you can ensure your safety by removing your channel view privileges from this bot.  </p>
