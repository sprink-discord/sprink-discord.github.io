### ComebackTwitterEmbed Privacy Policy
This bot can review the content of messages you send.  
This bot will only use the content of the message for processing and will not retrieve attachments or other files.  
The content of your message is only used to check if your message contains a tag that activates the automatic link embedding feature, and is not used for any other purpose.  
We also do not record the messages you send.  
You can always use the "/settings disable user" command to exclude yourself from message retrieval.  
If you are the server administrator, you can also use the "/settings disable channel" command to disable all messages in a particular channel.  
If (unfortunately) you don't trust us, you can ensure your safety by removing your channel view privileges from this bot.
